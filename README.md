# Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Car Specifications and Pricing

## Short Description
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing car specifications and pricing details. The analysis includes data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization to gain insights into factors affecting car prices and performance. The project focuses on identifying data distributions, outliers, and correlations between key attributes like horsepower, fuel efficiency, and price.

## Key Components Involved
### Programming Language
- Python

### Libraries Used
- **pandas** – for data manipulation
- **numpy** – for numerical operations
- **matplotlib & seaborn** – for data visualization
- **scipy.stats** – for statistical analysis
- **warnings** – to suppress warnings

## Data Preprocessing Steps
- Loading the dataset
- Removing unnecessary columns
- Renaming columns for better readability
- Handling duplicates and missing values
- Identifying and removing outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method

## Visualizations & Analysis
- Boxplots to detect outliers in attributes like horsepower, mileage (MPG), and price (MSRP)
- Distribution plots for understanding data spread
- Bar plots to analyze the number of cars by manufacturer
- Count plots to examine the relationship between transmission type and drive wheels
- Scatter plots to explore the relationship between engine horsepower and price
